Main Objectives and Goals of Research and Analysis:

- Creating plots for the correlations between the MRI Data and the corresponding luminescence (normalizing the scales)
- Proportionality of infection within the body components
- How often are the vagina/bladder infected together (thresholds)
- Generate a predictive model for the paired data
